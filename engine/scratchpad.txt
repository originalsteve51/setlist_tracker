Python program setlist_engine.py
________________________________


The SetList engine is a program that can access Spotify via their api.

The secret keys for accessing my Spotify account using the api are held in file secrets.sh

The secrets file also has my api key for accessing OpenAI programatically.

Finally, the secrets file has the (non-secret) url of the server where the web server
is running.

Do not attempt to upload secrets.sh to GitHub. It knows about secret keys and
will block any attempt to push them.

To start the program do the following

./activate_run.sh secrets.sh

activate_run.sh activates the Python virtual environment that includes libraries needed
to run the engine. This includes Spotipy (which wraps Spotify's api) and other libraries.

Once started issue 'playlists' command to see available playlists.

Next issue 'stagelist n', where n is the number of the playlist you want to load.

During stagelist processing, OpenAI is called to write a blurb about each song.

After a list is staged, issue the 'webload' command. This pushes the song information, including the OpenAI blurbs, to the web server.
